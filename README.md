# Apple M1 SMC Thoughts

Based on current experiments on my M1 iPad and speculations:

**PP0b** P-Cluster (Apple Firestorm \*4) Power

**PP1b** AGX (Apple GPU G13G) Power

**PPbb** E-Cluster (Apple Icestorm \*4) Power

Note that the same **HOLDS** for **V\*\*\*** and **I\*\*\*** values. That is, **VP0b** is P-Clus voltage, **IP0b** is P-Clus current, etc.
